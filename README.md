Anagram-Server
==============

This was an exercise on Day 1 of Phase 2 of Dev Bootcamp. 
(Each phase is 3 weeks long and cover different technologies and concepts). 
Phase 2 is when you first get exposure to the Web -- including REST, CRUD, androuting -- 
primarily by building applications in a Sinatra MVC framework. 

The application is a simple demonstration of GET requests rendering data from a server,
POST requests writing to a database, and internal redirects (new HTTP requests). Params are
passed to the server in both the URL (via wildcard) and through a form submission.

The point of the application is to simply generate anagrams from a word submission using 
a database of all words from Mac's dictionary (saved as a "words" text file in root). 

Simple app but keep in mind, this was Day 1 of using a browser to do anything!
